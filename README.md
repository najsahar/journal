## Lab 3
**Screenshots:** Available in [screenshots/Lab3](./screenshots/Lab3)  
**Lessons Learned:**
- Used `git commit -am` to quickly stage and commit changes.
- Viewed commit history with `git log -p`, `git show`, and `git log --stat`.
- Learned how `git diff -u` behaves depending on whether changes are staged or unstaged.
- Practiced file operations (`git rm` for deleting, `git mv` for renaming).
- Created and committed a `.gitignore` file to manage excluded files.

This milestone taught me the **full Git workflow** from setup to file management, which I will continue to use in future projects.
